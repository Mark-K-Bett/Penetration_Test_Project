 Penetration Testing Report

## Project Overview
This project documents a penetration test conducted on the networks **10.6.6.0/24** and **172.17.0.0/24**. The assessment includes identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses, and recommending remediation steps.

## Challenges Covered
1. **SQL Injection** - Identifying and exploiting an SQL vulnerability.
2. **Web Server Vulnerabilities** - Scanning and exploiting misconfigurations.
3. **SMB Exploitation** - Finding and exploiting open SMB shares.
4. **PCAP File Analysis** - Extracting useful data from a network capture.

## Tools Used
- **DVWA** for SQL Injection
<<<<<<< HEAD
